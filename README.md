# Parking Sensor

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/calvinmclean/parking-sensor)](https://github.com/calvinmclean/parking-sensor/blob/main/LICENSE)

This is an ESP32/Arduino firmware that provides distance sensing for parking a car. It uses a weatherproof ultrasonic distance sensor (JSN-SR04T) and an SPI OLED display (SSD1351 driver). It should also work with a standard HY-SRF05 ultrasonic sensor.

## Getting Started
Wire things up as indicated in the `config.h` and make any other changes in that file to fit your requirements. Compile and upload using Arduino IDE.
